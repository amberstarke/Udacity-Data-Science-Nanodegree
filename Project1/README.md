## Project Overview

This exploratory data analysis delves into World Bank data to compare key health indicators and identify factors influencing public health outcomes in Chile, Costa Rica, and Panama. By examining economic indicators, healthcare quality, and health outcome metrics, the project seeks to answer the following questions:

*   **Comparative Analysis:** How do key health indicators (e.g., life expectancy, infant mortality) compare across Chile, Costa Rica, and Panama?
*   **Growth Trends:** What were the growth rates of various economic and health outcome indicators in each country between 2012 and 2019?
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Are there significant correlations between economic indicators, health expenditure, and health outcomes? If so, which relationships are the most pronounced?
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Can we develop predictive models to forecast future health indicator values based on historical trends?
