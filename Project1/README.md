## Project Motivation
I wanted to look at 3 Latin American countries with similar Human Development Indexes, and compare their healthcare statistics. This involved analyzing various economic indicators, health outcome indicators, and healthcare quality.
The data I used is can be found on the WorldBank Databank website [here](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics).
I set out to answer a few key questions
  - Question 1: How do health indicators compare between Chile, Costa Rica and Panama?
  - Question 2: What are the growth rates from 2012-2019 for various economic and health outcome indicators for each country?
  - Question 3: Is there a correlation between economic indicators, health expenditure and health outcomes? If so, what relationships are the strongest?
  - Question 4: Can we predict future health indicators based on historical data?

## File Description
